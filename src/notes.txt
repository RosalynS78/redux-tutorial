!Rules
all properties on state have a reducers
all reducers get exported in the combineReducers object
all reducers must return state cannot return undefined - will return error!

hello: "hello Redux!",
cars: ["name"],
users: null,

(a function) - must return state for all properties must have reducers for all properties
const hello = () => state
const cars = () => state
const users = () => state


How to setup redux

npx create-react-app redx-tutorial
cd redux-tutorial
npm i redux react-redux
package.json file
rip out non used code in app.js

1. create state.js
{hello: "hello Redux!"}

2. create reducers.js
    rules:
    all properties on state have reducers
    all reducers get exported in the combineReducers object
    all reducers must return state

3. create store.js 
    import/export createStore 
    reducers first, state second 

4. import and wrap provider around the app
        import store and pass store as prop called store 

5. test the app to see it's still working  

smart containers and pass props
connect and mapStateToProps functions
